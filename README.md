# Benchmarking Ribbithole

## Purpose 

Sometimes I heavy love when folk croak about hings being slow and shite - I want to explore just how slow and shite some hings actually are and what better place than a full repo dedicated entirely towards this

This repo will never be complete; nor will it be comprehensive. I'm really just comparing things that I am interested in personally as and when they come up in my life


## Sections
- C# .Net
    - [Reflection](/dotnet/Reflection/README.md)



## Disclaimer

I'm aware am no going to be writing the most perfect code in the world here - or anywhere for that matter - there will always be hings I didn't know about, or hings I did and I just didny implement them because I didny think of them at the time of writing. 
So please, only slander the code if you know of improvements that can be made.

Any and all lines of code in this project are not held dear to my heart and if there is a better way of doing things I would absolutely love to hear about it ! Submit a PR and I'll forever hold yer improvement dear to me
